    title: "Integrity in Leadership",
    subheading: "The spirit of an organization is created from the top.",
    body: "The proof of the sincerity and seriousness of a management is uncompromising emphasis on integrity of character. This, above all, has to be symbolized in management’s “people” decisions. For it is character through which leadership is exercised; it is character that sets the example and is imitated. Character is not something one can fool people about. The people with whom a person works, and especially subordinates, know in a few weeks whether he or she has integrity or not. They may forgive a person for a great deal: incompetence, ignorance, insecurity, or bad manners. But they will not forgive a lack of integrity in that person. Nor will they forgive higher management for choosing him.\n\nThis is particularly true of the people at the head of an enterprise. For the spirit of an organization is created from the top. If an organization is great in spirit, it is because the spirit of its top people is great. If it decays, it does so because the top rots; as the proverb has it, “Trees die from the top.” No one should ever be appointed to a senior position unless top management is willing to have his or her character serve as the model for subordinates.",
    actionPoint: "Evaluate the character of the CEO and top management when considering a job offer. Align yourself with people who have integrity.",

    title: "Role of the Bystander",
    subheading: "...the bystander sees things neither actor nor audience notices.",
    body: "Bystanders have no history of their own. They are on the stage but are not part of the action. They are not even audience. The fortunes of the play and every actor in it depend on the audience, whereas the reaction of the bystander has no effect except on himself. But standing in the wings—much like the fireman in the theater—the bystander sees things neither actor nor audience notices. Above all, he sees differently from the way actors or audience see. Bystanders reflect, and reflection is a prism rather than a mirror; it refracts.\n\nTo watch and think for yourself is highly commendable. But “to shock people by shouting strange views from the rooftops is not.” The admonition is well taken. But I have rarely heeded it.",
    actionPoint: "Be a bystander to figure out what has to be done in your organization. Then act, but know you are running the risk of shocking people.",

    title: "The Change Leader",
    subheading: "The most effective way to manage change successfully is to create it.",
    body: "One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it. In a period of upheavals, such as the one we are living in, change is the norm. To be sure, it is painful and risky, and above all it requires a great deal of very hard work. But unless it is seen as the task of the organization to lead change, the organization will not survive. In a period of rapid structural change, the only ones who survive are the change leaders. A change leader sees change as an opportunity. A change leader looks for change, knows how to find the right changes, and knows how to make them effective both outside the organization and inside it. To make the future is highly risky. It is less risky, however, than not to try to make it. A goodly proportion of those attempting to will surely not succeed. But predictably, no one else will.",
    actionPoint: "Anticipate the future and be a change leader.",

    date: "April 8",
    title: "Leadership Is Responsibility",
    subheading: "Not enough generals were killed.",
    body: "All the effective leaders I have encountered—both those I worked with and those I merely watched—knew four simple things: a leader is someone who has followers; popularity is not leadership, results are; leaders are highly visible, they set examples; leadership is not rank, privilege, titles, or money, it is responsibility.\n\nWhen I was in my final high school years, our excellent history teacher—himself a badly wounded war veteran—told each of us to pick several of a whole spate of history books on World War I and write a major essay on our selections. When we then discussed these essays in class, one of my fellow students said, “Every one of these books says that the Great War was a war of total military incompetence. Why was it?” Our teacher did not hesitate a second but shot right back, “Because not enough generals were killed; they stayed way behind the lines and let others do the fighting and dying.” Effective leaders delegate, but they do not delegate the one thing that will set the standards. They do it.",
    actionPoint: "Don’t expect to retain the respect of your employees if you completely delegate the central function of your enterprise, whether it’s healing patients or selling bonds.",

    title: "Managing Knowledge Workers",
    subheading: "The management of people is a “marketing job.”",
    body: "The key to maintaining leadership in the economy and the technologies that are emerging is likely to be the social position of the knowledge professionals and social acceptance of their values. Today, however, we are trying to straddle the fence—to maintain the traditional mind-set, in which capital is the key resource and the financier is the boss, while bribing knowledge workers to be content to remain employees by giving them bonuses and stock options. But this, if it can work at all, can work only as long as the emerging industries enjoy a stock-market boom, as did the Internet companies.\n\nThe management of knowledge workers is a “marketing job.” And in marketing one does not begin with the question: “What do we want?” One begins with the questions: “What does the other party want? What are its values? What are its goals? What does it consider results?” What motivates knowledge workers is what motivates volunteers. Volunteers have to get more satisfaction from their work than paid employees, precisely because they don’t get a paycheck. They need, above all, challenges.",

    date: "June 1",
    title: "Managing Oneself",
    subheading: "Knowledge workers must take responsibility for managing themselves.",
    body: "Knowledge workers are likely to outlive their employing organization. Their average working life is likely to be fifty years. But the average life expectancy of a successful business is only thirty years. Increasingly, therefore, knowledge workers will outlive any one employer, and will have to be prepared for more than one job. And this means most knowledge workers will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES. They have to place themselves where they can make the greatest contribution; they will have to learn to develop themselves. They will have to learn how and when to change what they do, how they do it, and when they do it.\n\nThe key to managing oneself is to know: Who am I? What are my strengths? How do I work to achieve results? What are my values? Where do I belong? Where do I not belong? Finally, a crucial step in successfully managing oneself is FEEDBACK ANALYSIS. Record what you expect the results to be of every key action or key decision you take, and then compare ACTUAL RESULTS nine months or a year later to your expectations.",
    actionPoint: "Manage yourself by knowing your strengths, values, and where you do best. Then use feedback analysis by, first, recording what you expect the results of key actions or decisions to be, and then nine months or a year later, comparing the actual results to those expectations.",

    date: "July 1",
    title: "Theory of the Business",
    subheading: "A clear, simple, and penetrating theory of the business, rather than intuition, characterizes the truly successful entrepreneur.",
    body: "A theory of the business has three parts. First, there are assumptions about the environment of the organization: society and its structure, the market, the customer, and technology. The assumptions about the environment define what an organization is paid for. Second, there are assumptions about the specific mission of the organization. The assumptions about mission define what an organization considers to be meaningful results—they point to how it envisions itself making a difference in the economy and society at large. Third, there are assumptions about the core competencies needed to accomplish the organization’s mission. Core competencies define where an organization must excel in order to maintain leadership.\n\nEvery one of the great business builders we know of—from the Medici and the founders of the Bank of England down to IBM’s Thomas Watson in our day—had a definite idea, had, indeed, a clear theory of the business that informed his actions and decisions. A clear, simple, and penetrating theory of the business, rather than intuition, characterizes the truly successful entrepreneur, the person who builds an organization that can endure and grow long after he or she is gone.",

    date: "August 4",
    title: "Managing the New Venture",
    subheading: "Every new project is an infant and infants belong in the nursery.",
    body: "Innovative efforts, especially those aimed at developing new businesses, products, or services, should normally report directly to the “executive in charge of innovation.” They should never report to line managers charged with responsibility for ongoing operations. Unfortunately, this is a common error.\n\nThe new project is an infant and will remain one for the foreseeable future, and infants belong in the nursery. The “adults,” that is, the executives in charge of existing businesses or products, will have neither time nor understanding for the infant project. The best-known practitioners of this approach are three American companies: Procter & Gamble, the soap, detergent, edible oil, and food producer; Johnson & Johnson, the hygiene and health-care supplier; and 3M, a major manufacturer of industrial and consumer products. These three companies differ in the details of practice, but essentially all three have the same policy. They set up the new venture as a separate business from the beginning and put a project manager in charge.",
    actionPoint: "Keep infant businesses in the nursery. Separate “infants” from “adults.”",
